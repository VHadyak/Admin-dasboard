# Admin-dasboard
This project was designed to practice using the combination of flexbox and grid, and develop more skills and knowledge about responsiveness.
In addition, experimenting with css functions for responsivenes such as min(), max(), calc(), clamp(),
minmax(), etc..

Regardless, this was a fun CSS project to get more familiar with using grid/flex combination!
